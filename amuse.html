      <h2>The Best of Vine</h2>
      <p>Before Tik Tok, there was another short video app, known as Vine. Vine blew up quickly, and led to the rise of many "social influencers" today, including the Paul brothers, Jake and Logan.</p>

      <h2>Super Bowl Commercials</h2>
      <p>When watching a show, sports game, or movie on TV, typically you tune out or ignore commercials. I know for me this is my time to check my phone and tune out. However, the one day that I actually look forward to commercials, is the day of the Super Bowl.
      A lot of people actually watch the Super bowl just for the commercials, which in history have produced great comedy. Some companies like Doritos go all out on these commercials.
      Linked below is a compilation of some of the best Super Bowl commercials of all time.</p>

      <h2>Substitute Mis=pronouncing Names</h2>
      <p>We all know some names can be very confusing to pronounce or read at first glance. Some however can be very easy. About 11 years ago, legendary comedy duo Key & Peele made a skit about how difficult some can be, or just how foolish some people can be.</p>
