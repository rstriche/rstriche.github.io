        <h2>What makes a hero?</h2>
        <p>A hero is someone that we look up to. Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as role models says a lot about who we are as people.</p>
        <p>Over time there are a lot of example of people to look back at as inspirational. One that has always stuck out to me is Kobe Bryant. Kobe Bryant is known for his work ethic, his love for basketball, and his drive for success, all encompassed into what is known as the "mamba mentality".</p>
